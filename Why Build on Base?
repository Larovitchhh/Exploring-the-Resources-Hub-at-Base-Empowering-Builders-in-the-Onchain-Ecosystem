Base stands out as a builder-friendly Ethereum L2 platform due to its low fees (transactions below one cent), fast transaction speeds (below one second), and global reach with onramps in over 190 countries. By leveraging the Optimism Superchain and Coinbase’s infrastructure, Base ensures scalability and trust, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to create apps for a global audience.

The Resources Hub is a testament to Base’s commitment to empowering builders. Whether it’s through funding, technical tools, or community support, Base provides a robust ecosystem that encourages innovation and growth. As the platform evolves, it continues to invest in five key pillars: builders, apps, ownership, markets, and bringing everyone onchain.
